##Blood Oxygen Level Monitor Ring

I propose to build a SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Level) monitoring ring, allowing user to know their current health condition.


##Summary

Blood oxygen level is a crucial value for health, its closely related to brain activities and physical performance. Users with asthma, myself as an example, often have compressed chest and tired of breathing, therefore holds breath unconciously and drops Spo2 dramatically. Healthy people usually rated 95-100%, dropping below 95% is abnormal, and below 90% could be potentially harmful over time. It is common for many of the athletes / fitness enthusiast to experience short of breath, because recruiting muslce fibers requires large amount of oxygen, insufficent oxygen due to breathing problem will cause dizziness and lower physical performance, and eventually lead to injury. Many amateurs, even coaches would have their athletes rest a fixed amount time between sets, from 30s to 2 minutes, this rest time between sets is often determined the goals of the athletes (muscle building/ power training), which often will not be enough for users with breathing problems. The SpO2 ring can help the users determine when their body is ready to work, both physically and mentally. Ultimately the ring will vibrate and signal the user when their Spo2 level has reached an ideal level.
